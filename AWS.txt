EC2:-
-----
-EC2 stands for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud.
-Amazon EC2 is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
-Amazon EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new user instances to minutes rather than in older days.
-Amazon has provided an EC2 which is a virtual machine in the cloud that completely changes the industry.
-Rather than you previously buy physical servers, you would look for a server that has more CPU capacity, 
 RAM capacity and you buy a server over 5 year term, so you have to plan for 5 years in advance. 
 People spend a lot of capital in such investments. 
 EC2 allows you to pay for the capacity that you actually use.
-You can scale the compute capacity up and down as per the computing requirement changes.S
